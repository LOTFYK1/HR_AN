# Employee Overview

## Description
This project contains an HR data analysis report. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using Python, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover insights. An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to help HR teams monitor key metrics and trends, including Age, Department, Salary, Years at Company, and Attrition status.

## Files
- `HR_Analytics.pbix` : Power BI report file
- `data_hr_c.py` : Python script for cleaning and preprocessing the data
